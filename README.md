# Company-Network-Design-Implementation-
🌐 Company Network Design Project – Cisco Packet Tracer
This project is a complete company network setup built using Cisco Packet Tracer, designed to connect multiple departments smoothly and efficiently.

✨ What We Did:
Created a multi-router, multi-switch network to simulate a real company environment.

Used IP addressing and subnetting to organize the network smartly.

Configured routing protocols and VLANs to make sure all parts of the network can talk to each other.

Ran real-time simulations to test everything : packets were delivered successfully and the network worked perfectly!

🔧 Tools & Skills:
Cisco Packet Tracer

Subnetting & IP Addressing

Routing (RIP, OSPF, etc.)

VLAN Configuration

Network Troubleshooting & Simulation

✅ A well-structured, real-time tested network ready for real-world use!
